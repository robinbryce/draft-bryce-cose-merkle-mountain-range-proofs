Without the context that I already have, I'm not sure its clear from the definition if `e` is the subset of `i` that are leaves, or if `e` is a zero-based enumeration of the leaves.\r\n2. It might be more intuitive to just inline `(h - 1)` rather than adding `g` as an additional variable to remember.\r\n3. Extend the zero-based and one-based descriptions to all of the variables where relevant (e.g. for `i` and `pos`.)\r\n4. Later in the document, `D` is referred to, without a definition - so it might be helpful to add that here.",
